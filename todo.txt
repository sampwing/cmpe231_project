      * save classes to profile as classes you've taken.
      * figure out edit button styling when dynamically adding class
   * add edit buttons to major selection- classes i've taken pages
   * Add correct courseID when you dynamically add a class (correct quarter+class+quarterlength)
   * Figure out Auto Fill the rest of the schedule

   * Figure out calculation for percentage of major done
   * Editing major/minor selection 
   * 
      * create a duplicate of selection page, w/ django
